# webcam_point_features
Detection of ORB features from online webcam imges.

With ORB open_cv features you can obtain the most important points in a webcam image, and see them how they change during the time if you move the object, for example, your hand.

"Add hand image"

It works selecting some points, gives them a direction, and it searches the points in the next frame and see the position and the direction. So you can know if the object has changed the postition and it's direction or not.
